        volumes:
            - ./data:/var/www/html/data

            - MYSQL_SERVER=IPADDRESS
            - MYSQL_USERNAME=USERNAME
            - MYSQL_PASSWORD=PASSWORD
            # change below to mysql if you don't want to use sqlite
            # you will need to have a mysql server (set above) with a blank database already created.
            - DBTYPE=sqlite
            # if using Mysql remove the data/ from the below line
            # if using Sqlite the data/ is required!

# Docker Run

SQLITE: 
```
docker run -d -p 8259:80 -v ./data:/var/www/html/data -e DBTYPE=sqlite -e DBNAME=data/tasmobackup --name TasmoBackup danmed/tasmobackupv1
```
Note : pay attention to the difference's between the sqlite and mysql database names.

MYSQL:
```
docker run -d -p 8259:80 -v ./data:/var/www/html/data -e DBTYPE=mysql -e MYSQL_SERVER=192.168.2.10 -e MYSQL_USERNAME=root -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=password -e DBNAME=tasmobackup --name TasmoBackup danmed/tasmobackupv1
```

# Install via Raw PHP
```
git clone https://github.com/danmed/TasmoBackupV1
cd TasmoBackupV1
mkdir data
chown www-data data
cp config.inc.php.example data/config.inc.php
```

Edit data/config.inc.php if you wish to change to using mysql database
instead of sqlite.
Make sure the data directory is owned by the user php runs as, or it will
not be able to save your backups or create/update the sqlite file

Run the upgrade.php script to initialize your new database, or to upgrade
your existing one when changing versions.

# Scheduled Backups
* backupall.php exists to do literally that.. Schedule this with your chosen means (nodered, curl, scheduled tasks etc)
